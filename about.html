                    <p>Started in 2014, SOTA Cyberdragons has been encouraging STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) through challenges tackled with modern technology. Throughout the years incoming members will develop a myriad of skills involving, cooperation and coordination. SOTA Cyberdragons is a team of artists from many backgrounds, banded together in order to form a unique innovation.</p>
                    <p>Our very first competition was the spring break of 2015 at FRC's Silicon Valley Regional. Although we may have not achieved a notable rank, the experience we have gained from the competition will lead to our development as an outstanding team. This hypothesis proved to be true when in early October we competed in WRRF's CalGames 2015. Here we our results were far better than we expected. We went home with two awards: the Highest Seeding Rookie Award and the Rookie Inspiration Award.</p>

                    <p>The Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts offers a highly creative alternative for students who seek in-depth study of the arts as part of their daily high school experience. </p>
                    <p>Students attend academic classes each morning on a rotating block schedule. In the afternoon, at least 2 to 3 hours daily are devoted to their art discipline, where they are taught and mentored by their Arts Directors and a corps of Artists-in-Residence from the broader arts community. In addition to fulfilling their academic responsibilities, students spend their time in rehearsals, studio time, outside lessons, training, showcases and performances,</p>
                    <p>With just over 600 students, Asawa SOTA is one of the smallest high schools in the district, and also one of the highest-achieving in standardized test scores and college admissions. The 4-Year Plan meets all University of California A through G requirements and an array of Honors and AP classes give students access to intellectually challenging coursework. The majority of SOTA graduates pursue higher education, most at traditional colleges and universities, and about ten percent at conservatories and art academies nationwide. </p>
